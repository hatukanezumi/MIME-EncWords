2011-10-26	Hatuka*nezumi - IKEDA Soji	<hatuka@nezumi.nu>

	* Release 1.012.4.
	* Chg: encode_mimewords(): 'B' was advantageous over 'Q' by 4/3 byte
	  on average...
	* Updated address of FSF.

2011-06-05	Hatuka*nezumi - IKEDA Soji	<hatuka@nezumi.nu>

	* Release 1.012.3.
	* Fix: encode_mimewords(): inproper handling of Encoding => 'S'.
	* Imp: decode_mimewords(): Broken "Q" encoding also warned: "=" not
	  leading two hexdigits (raw " " and "\t" are allowed).
	* Imp: encode_mimewords(): negative MaxLineLen allows unlimited length
	  of line.
	* Encode::MIME::EncWords: Rewritten. 0.03.
	  - Any newlines not forming folding white space are preserved.
	    cf. CPAN RT #68582 for standard encodings.
	  - Error handling.
	* Doc: typos etc.

2011-06-01	Hatuka*nezumi - IKEDA Soji	 <hatuka@nezumi.nu>

	* Release 1.012.2.
	* Chg: encode_mimewords(): By 'A' or 'S' encodings, 'Q' will be used
	  more often: When number of bytes to be encoded exceeds 6th of
	  entire bytes, words may be encoded by 'B'.  In other words,
	  ``S encoding'' is to choose shorter one of 'B' or 'Q' according to
	  length of maximally-encoded result.
	* Fix: encode_mimewords(): Pure ASCII words containing unsafe sequence
	  ignored Encoding option; encoded by header_encoding() of its charset.
	* Updated Encode::MIME::EncWords.
	* Added test #03 & #04.  Added UTF-8 cases to #02.

	  according to RFC 2047 section 5 (3).
	  Note: length(encode_mimeword()) may not be equal to
	  encoded_header_len() of MIME::Charset 1.004 or earlier.
	* Bug Fix: Texts with ``US-ASCII transformation'' charsets,
	  HZ-GB-2312 (RFC 1842) and UTF-7 (RFC 2152), were treated
	  as US-ASCII.
	* Fix: encoded-words exceeding line length can be generated.
	* encode_mimewords(): Improved encoding of unsafe ASCII
	  sequences (words exceeding line length or including ``=?'').

	  no conversion to keep compatible with MIME::Words.
	* Remove multibyte tests on pre-Encode environments
	  where it cannot be supported exactly.
	* Restructured processing of option parameters.
	* Added tests for decoding multibyte and encoding singlebyte.
